>This quick start uses `macOS` in the examples. For instructions about how to install Hugo on other operating systems, see [install](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
>It is recommended to have [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to run this tutorial.


## Step 1: Install Hugo

>`Homebrew`, a package manager for `macOS`,  can be installed from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/). See [install](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) if you are running Windows etc.


```bash
brew install hugo
```

To verify your new install:

```bash
hugo version
```


## Step 2: Create a New Site

```bash
hugo new site quickstart
```

The above will create a new Hugo site in a folder named `quickstart`.


## Step 3: Add a Theme

See [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/) for a list of themes to consider. This quickstart uses the beautiful [Ananke theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/).

```bash
cd quickstart

# Download the theme
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
# Note for non-git users:
#   - If you do not have git installed, you can download the archive of the latest
#     version of this theme from:
#       https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke/archive/master.zip
#   - Extract that .zip file to get a "gohugo-theme-ananke-master" directory.
#   - Rename that directory to "ananke", and move it into the "themes/" directory.
# End of note for non-git users.

# Edit your config.toml configuration file
# and add the Ananke theme.
echo 'theme = "ananke"' >> config.toml
```


## Step 4: Add Some Content

You can manually create content files (for example as `content/<CATEGORY>/<FILE>.<FORMAT>`) and provide metadata in them, however you can use `new` commend to do few things for you (like add title and date):

```
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```


Edit the newly created content file if you want, it will start with something like this:

```markdown
---
title: "My First Post"
date: 2019-03-26T08:47:11+01:00
draft: true
---

```


## Step 5: Start the Hugo server

Now, start the Hugo server with drafts enabled:




```
â–¶ hugo server -D

Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
Press Ctrl+C to stop
```


**Navigate to your new site at [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/).**

Feel free to edit or add new content and simply refresh in browser to see changes quickly (You might need to force refresh in webbrowser, something like Ctrl-R usually works).


## Step 6: Customize the Theme

Your new site already looks great, but you will want to tweak it a little before you release it to the public.

### Site Configuration

Open up `config.toml` in a text editor:

```
baseURL = "https://example.org/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "My New Hugo Site"
theme = "ananke"
```

Replace the `title` above with something more personal. Also, if you already have a domain ready, set the `baseURL`. Note that this value is not needed when running the local development server.


>**Tip:** Make the changes to the site configuration or any other file in your site while the Hugo server is running, and you will see the changes in the browser right away, though you may need to clear your cache.



For theme specific configuration options, see the [theme site](https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke).


## Step 7: Build static pages

It is simple. Just call:

```
hugo
```

Output will be in `./public/` directory by default (`-d`/`--destination` flag to change it, or set `publishdir` in the config file).
